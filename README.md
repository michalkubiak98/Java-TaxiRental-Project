# Java TaxiRental Project

For this project to work correctly you must import the JFeonix jar file into scene builder and connect to your own local oracle server

In this project at the end of my first year of college, I made a Java GUI Application using modern GUI libraries and connected the app to a database, something no one else did. The app was not finished, as i was just learning as I went along. The application concept was a login and sign up followed by a list of taxis in your area which were hardcoded and on clicking one it would display the price for amount of miles you would like to travel.
